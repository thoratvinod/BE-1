## 15. Use Python/R and Perform following on Iris dataset. 1) How many features are there and what are their types (e.g., numeric, nominal) 2) Compute and display summary statistics for each feature available in the dataset. (eg. minimum value, maximum value, mean, range, standard deviation, variance and percentiles 1) Data Visualization-Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to illustrate the feature distributions. Plot each histogram. 2) Create a boxplot for each feature in the dataset. All of the boxplots should be combinedinto a single plot. Compare distributions and identify outliers.
